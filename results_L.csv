Shorter waves tend to be seen as violet and blue, longer ones as orange and red. The sun produces white light, which is a mixture of all the visible wavelengths. Sometimes, drops of moisture in the air act like a prism: They separate the sun's white light into the colors of the visible spectrum, and we are treated to a rainbow."", 'Brightness is the dimension of visual experience related to the amount, or intensity, of the light an object emits or reflects, and corresponds to the amplitude (maximum height) of the light wave. Generally, the more light an object reflects, the brighter it appears. However, brightness is also affected by wavelength: Yellows appear brighter than reds and blues even when their physical intensities are equal.', 'Saturation (colorfulness) is the dimension of visual experience related to the complexity of light—that is, to how wide or narrow the range of wavelengths is. When light contains only a single wavelength, it is said to be pure, and the resulting color is completely saturated. White light, in contrast, contains all the wavelengths of visible light (corresponding to all the colors in the visible spectrum) and has zero saturation. Black is a lack of any light at all (has no color), and so is also completely unsaturated. In nature, pure light is extremely rare. We usually sense a mixture of wavelengths, and as a result we see colors that are duller and paler than completely saturated ones.']]"
