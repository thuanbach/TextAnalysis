Cultural factors can also generate dissatisfaction with one's body. Bulimia is rare to nonexistent in non-Western cultures and has only become a significant problem in Western cultures with the rise of the thin ideal for women ("),d.Nb(434,"a",234),d.kc(435,"Keel & Klump, 2003"),d.Mb(),d.kc(436,"). A meta-analysis of experimental and correlational studies found that women's exposure to the media ideal of impossibly thin women fosters the belief that \u201cthin is beautiful\u201d and increases the risk of disordered eating ("),d.Nb(437,"a",235),d.kc(438,"Grabe, Ward, & Hyde, 2008"),d.Mb(),d.kc(439,"; "),d.Nb(440,"a",236),d.kc(441,"Slevec & Tiggemann, 2011"),d.Mb(),d.kc(442,"). American culture is also rife with body snarking, the relentlessly critical and snide appraisals of other people's bodies that get posted on blogs, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, and are constant topics for entertainment magazines and talk shows ("),d.Nb(443,"a",237),d.kc(444,"Boepple & Thompson, 2015"),d.Mb(),d.kc(445,")."),d.Mb(),d.Nb(446,"figure",238),d.Lb(447,"img",239),d.Nb(448,"figcaption",240),d.Nb(449,"div",241),d.Nb(450,"p",242),d.kc(451,"Some argue that the increased prevalence of anorexia and other eating disorders is a product of girls and women seeing ultra-thin fashion models on the pages of magazines.

Eating disorders and body image distortions among boys and men are increasing too, though they take different forms. Just as anorexic women see their gaunt bodies as being too fat, some men have the delusion that their muscular bodies are too puny, so they abuse steroids and exercise or pump iron compulsively ("),d.Nb(457,"a",245),d.kc(458,"Thompson & Cafri, 2007"),d.Mb(),d.kc(459,"). In contrast, Chinese men in Taiwan and pastoral nomads of northern Kenya do not think the heavily muscled male body is especially desirable or attractive, and their cultures do not promote media images of muscular males.

Students work at studying. Homemakers work, often more hours than salaried employees, at running a household. Artists, poets, and actors work, even if they are paid erratically (or not at all). Most people are motivated to work in order to meet the needs for food and shelter. Yet survival does not explain why some people want to do their work well and others just want to get it done.
