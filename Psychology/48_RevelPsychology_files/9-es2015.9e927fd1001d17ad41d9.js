During sleep, consolidation seems to target important information that we know we might need later. When researchers had people learn new information and then let them sleep, those who were told before sleeping that they would later be taking a memory test did better on it than those who did not know about the upcoming test ("),d.Nb(344,"a",184),d.kc(345,"Wilhelm et al., 2011"),d.Mb(),d.kc(346,"). Sleep seems to strengthen many kinds of memories, including the recollection of events, locations, facts, and emotional experiences, especially negative ones (see "),d.Nb(347,"a",185),d.Nb(348,"span",186),d.kc(349,"Figure"),d.Mb(),d.Nb(350,"span",187),d.kc(351,"5.4"),d.Mb(),d.Mb(),d.kc(352,")."),d.Mb(),d.Nb(353,"figure",188),d.Nb(354,"header"),d.Nb(355,"h1",189),d.Nb(356,"span",45),d.kc(357,"Figure"),d.Mb(),d.Nb(358,"span",46),d.kc(359,"5.4"),d.Mb(),d.Mb(),d.Nb(360,"p",190),d.kc(361,"Sleep and Memory Consolidation"),d.Mb(),d.Mb(),d.Nb(362,"div",48),d.Nb(363,"div",49),d.Lb(364,"img",191),d.Mb(),d.Mb(),d.Nb(365,"div",192),d.Lb(366,"iframe",193),d.Mb(),d.Nb(367,"figcaption"),d.Nb(368,"div",194),d.Nb(369,"p",195),d.kc(370,"When college students studied neutral scenes (e.g., an ordinary car) and emotionally negative scenes (e.g., a car totaled in an accident), sleep affected how well they later recognized the objects in the scenes.

In one study, while scientists taught people the locations of several matching pairs of cards (a memory game), they also presented the scent of roses. Later, some people were exposed to the smell of roses again during slow-wave sleep, REM sleep, or when they were awake. Exposure to the smell during slow-wave sleep, but not REM or wakefulness, improved people's memories for the card locations ("),d.Nb(373,"a",197),d.kc(374,"Rasch et al., 2007"),d.Mb(),d.kc(375,").

The volunteers were not told about a hidden shortcut that would enable them to calculate the final digit almost immediately. One group was trained in the evening and then got to snooze for 8 hours before returning to the problem. Another group was also trained in the evening but then stayed awake for 8 hours before coming back to the problem. A third group was trained in the morning and stayed awake all day, as they normally would, before taking the test.

Among college students, who are often worried about grades and tests, test-anxiety dreams are common: The dreamer is unprepared for or unable to finish an exam, or shows up for the wrong exam, or can't find the room where the exam is being given. Traumatic experiences can also affect people's dreams. In a cross-cultural study in which children kept dream diaries for a week, Palestinian children living in neighborhoods under threat of violence reported more themes of persecution and violence than did Finnish or Palestinian children living in peaceful environments ("),d.Nb(96,"a",53),d.kc(97,"Punamaeki & Joustie, 1998"),d.Mb(),d.kc(98,")."),d.Mb(),d.Nb(99,"p",54),d.kc(100,"Some psychologists believe that dreams not only reflect our waking concerns but also provide us with an opportunity to resolve them.
