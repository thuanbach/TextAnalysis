It delivers a large current through a wire coil placed on a person's head. The current produces a magnetic field about 40,000 times greater than the earth's natural magnetic field, causing neurons under the coil to fire. Although TMS can be used to produce motor responses, such as a thumb twitch or a knee jerk, researchers can also use it to briefly inactivate an area and observe the effects on behavior. The drawback is that when neurons fire, they cause many other neurons to become active too, so it can be hard to tell which neurons are critical for a particular task. Still, TMS has been useful for examining the role of various brain regions in everything from vision to emotion to language ("),d.Nb(52,"a",35),d.kc(53,"van deRuit, Perenboom, & Grey, 2015"),d.Mb(),d.kc(54,"). As we will see, the left hemisphere of the brain plays a significant role in language, but TMS shows that the right side is important as well. TMS over the right hemisphere causes people to lose the ability to understand metaphors (\u201ca blanket of snow\u201d); although they still understand the individual words in the metaphor, they no longer can see the relationship between them ("),d.Nb(55,"a",36),d.kc(56,"Pobric et al., 2008"),d.Mb(),d.kc(57,")."),d.Mb(),d.Nb(58,"p",37),d.Nb(59,"a",38),d.kc(60,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"),d.Mb(),d.kc(61," is an even newer way of studying brain function. The researcher applies a very small electric current to an area of the cortex, the outer surface of the brain ("),d.Nb(62,"a",39),d.kc(63,"Cohen Kadosh, 2015"),d.Mb(),d.kc(64,"). Depending on the direction of the current, brain activity in that area is either temporarily stimulated or suppressed. In one study, applying current in one direction increased activity, improving people's memory for the information they gained during one task while they focused on doing another.

hemispheres that control opposite sides of the body. Although similar in structure, these hemispheres have somewhat separate talents, or areas of specialization. Hemispheric specialization is especially apparent in patients who have suffered brain damage, usually as a result of a stroke. Those with left-hemisphere damage may lose the ability to speak or understand language, whereas those with right-hemisphere damage rarely do. A French neurologist named Paul Broca (whose name lives on in the term "),d.Nb(17,"i",12),d.kc(18,"Broca's area"),d.Mb(),d.kc(19,") first made this observation in 1861, and many behavioral and cognitive difficulties associated with left- or right-hemisphere damage have been documented since then. Patients with left-hemisphere damage may have difficulties with reading, identifying objects, making symbolic gestures or pantomimes, and describing events in the correct order. For their part, patients with right-hemisphere damage may have difficulty identifying faces, interpreting emotional expressions in a face or voice, or understanding music or art.
