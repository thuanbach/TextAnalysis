Memory confers competence; without it, we would be as helpless as newborns, unable to carry out even the most trivial of our daily tasks. Memory also gives us our sense of who we are, for if we are not the sum of our recollections, then who are we? Our very identity depends on our memories, which is why we feel so threatened when others challenge them. Individuals and cultures alike rely on a remembered history for a sense of coherence and meaning. Memory gives us our past and guides our future.

The operation did achieve its goal: Henry's seizures became milder and could be controlled by medication. But his memory had been affected profoundly: He could no longer remember new experiences for much longer than 15 minutes. Facts, songs, stories, and faces all vanished like water down a drain.

This good-natured man felt sad that he could never make friends because he could never remember anyone, not even the scientists who studied him for decades.

Primacy effects happen because the first few items in a list are rehearsed many times and so are likely to make it to long-term memory and remain memorable. Recency effects occur because at the time of recall, they are plucked out of short-term memory, where they are still sitting. The items in the middle of a list are not so well retained because by the time they get into short-term memory, it is already crowded with the first few items. As a result, middle items often drop out of short-term memory before they can be stored in long-term memory.
