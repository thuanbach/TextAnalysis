In 1997, the FDA permitted pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to the public, a practice still forbidden in most of the rest of the world; sales of new drugs skyrocketed as consumers began to request them. Because ads promise such wonderful results, medication often seems the best way to deal with an emotional or behavioral problem; yet nonmedical treatments may work just as well or better. Consider this study of more than 168,000 children who had been referred to a behavioral-care facility to be treated for attention-deficit disorder. More than 60 percent of the boys and 23 percent of the girls were on Ritalin or another drug. But after six sessions of behavior therapy for the children and 10 sessions for the parent, only 11 percent of the boys and 2 percent of the girls remained on medication ("),d.Nb(379,"a",205),d.kc(380,"Cummings & Wiggins, 2001"),d.Mb(),d.kc(381,"; see also "),d.Nb(382,"a",206),d.kc(383,"March, 2011"),d.Mb(),d.kc(384,")."),d.Mb(),d.Mb(),d.Nb(385,"li",207),d.Nb(386,"p",208),d.Nb(387,"span",209),d.kc(388,"Unknown risks over time and drug interactions."),d.Mb(),d.kc(389," The effects of taking antidepressants indefinitely are still unknown, especially for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and older adults\u2014or for the generation of young adults who have been taking them since childhood or adolescence, when the brain is still developing.

In the past, there were many horror stories about the misuse of ECT and its dire effects on memory. Today, however, patients are given muscle relaxants and anesthesia, so they sleep through the procedure and their convulsions are minimized. The World Psychiatric Association and the FDA have endorsed ECT as safe and effective, especially for people with episodes of crippling depression and suicidal impulses and for those who have not responded to other treatments (Shorter & Healy, 2008).
