But perhaps they have simply learned to be comfortable with strangers. Moreover, although a small correlation exists between a mother's sensitivity to her child and the security of her child's attachment, this doesn't tell us which causes which, or whether something else causes both sensitivity and secure attachment.

At about age 10, their moral judgments shift to ones based on conformity and loyalty to others, and then to an understanding of the rule of law. In adulthood, a few individuals go on to develop a moral standard based on universal human rights.

to the period of development between the age at which a person becomes capable of sexual reproduction and adulthood. For most of human history, this time span has been only a few months, and this is still true in some cultures, where a sexually mature boy or girl is expected to marry and assume adult tasks. In modern Western societies, however, teenagers are not considered emotionally mature enough to assume the full rights, responsibilities, and roles of adulthood.
