senses: vision, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. Actually, we have more than five senses. The skin, which is the organ of touch or pressure, also senses heat, cold, and pain, not to mention itching and tickling. The ear, which is the organ of hearing, also contains receptors that account for a sense of balance. The skeletal muscles contain receptors responsible for a sense of bodily movement."),r.Mb(),r.Nb(17,"p",12),r.kc(18,"All of our senses evolved to help us survive. Even pain, which causes so much human misery, is an indispensable part of our evolutionary heritage, for it alerts us to illness and injury. Some people are born with a rare condition that prevents them from feeling the usual hurts and aches of life, but you shouldn't envy them: They are susceptible to burns, bruises, and broken bones, and they often die at an early age because they can't take advantage of pain's warning signals. In this section we will examine the basics of how sensation takes place, from the painful jab of a wasp sting to the breathtaking vision of a glorious sunset.

According to this doctrine, different sensory modalities (such as vision and hearing) exist because signals received by the sense organs stimulate different nerve pathways leading to different areas of the brain.

In fact, a similar sort of crossover does occur if you close your right eye and press lightly on the right side of the lid: You will see a flash of light seemingly coming from one left. The pressure produces an impulse that travels up the optic nerve to the visual area in the right side of the brain, where it is interpreted as coming from the left side of the visual field. By taking advantage of such crossover from one sense to another, researchers hope to enable blind people to see by teaching them to interpret impulses from other senses that are then routed to the visual areas of the brain. Neuroscientists have developed a device that translates images from a camera into a pattern of electronic pulses that is sent to electrodes on the tongue, which in turn sends information about the pattern to visual areas of the brain that process images ("),r.Nb(102,"a",63),r.kc(103,"Chebat et al., 2011"),r.Mb(),r.kc(104,"; "),r.Nb(105,"a",64),r.kc(106,"Proulx, Ptito, & Amedi, 2014"),r.Mb(),r.kc(107,").
